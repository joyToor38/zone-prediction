    <h4 style="font-weight: normal;">
        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Zone IV is considered the high-damage risk zone. The IS Code allots 0.24 to this zone. Moreover, 18% of
                the total area of the country belongs to Zone IV.</li>


            <li>This zone is susceptible to strong earthquakes, which create panic all over, moving even heavy
                furniture. Such earthquakes could cause moderate damage in well-designed/built structures/buildings,
                while poorly built structures suffer great damage. Other effects could be landslides on steep slopes,
                cracks in the ground up to widths of a few centimeters, and water in lakes could become turbid.
                (Intensity: VIII)</li>

            <ul>
                
                <li> During earthquakes, drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it
                    so that it doesn’t move away from you. Wait there until the shaking stops.</li>
                <li>Heavy objects such as televisions, computers, and stereos are usually placed on top of cabinets,
                    bookcases, and tables. Fasten these items so they will not slide off during an earthquake. Such
                    simple structural measures are vital to maintaining safety during an earthquake.</li>
                <li>Secure your water tank</li>
                <li>Secure the flower pots from falling off.</li>
                <li>Check for fire and, if any, have it controlled.</li>
                <li>Check your water and electrical lines for defects.</li>
                <li>If you are inside an old or weak structure, take the fastest and safest way out.</li>
                <li>Do not use elevators.</li>
                <li>After the shaking stops, take the staircase to reach open space.</li>
                <li>If you are not near an exit or, you are situated in High Rise building/ upstairs stay inside. Do not
                    panic; stay calm and take necessary action.</li>
                <li>DROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD
                    ON until the shaking stops. If there is not a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with
                    your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.</li>
                <li>Protect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a
                    table or even under a bed.</li>
                <li>Move away from power lines, posts, walls, false ceiling, parapet, falling flower pots and other
                    elements that may fall or collapse.</li>
                <li>Stay away from buildings with glass panes.</li>
                <li>If you are on a steep hillside, move away in case of landslides and falling rocks.</li>
                <li>When driving a vehicle pull to the side of the road and stop.</li>
                <li>Don’t enter partially damaged buildings. Strong aftershocks can cause further damage to the
                    buildings and weak structures may collapse.</li>
                <li>Don’t use your telephone to call relatives and friends, call only for medical help.</li>
                <li>Don’t use your two-wheeler/car to drive around the areas of damage. Rescue and relief operations
                    need the road for mobility.</li>
                <li>Do not fill the overhead tank completely.</li>
                <li>Do not carry out haphazard repairs. </li>
                <li>Repairs should be done only under the supervision of a structural engineer.</li>
                <li>Do not put additional supports without the guidance of an experienced/qualified structural engineer.
                </li>
