        <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Zone V has the highest risk of damaging earthquakes. The IS Code has assigned a factor of 0.36 for this
                very high-risk damage zone. Around 11% of India falls under Zone V.</li>


            <li>This is the maximum risk zone in the country and is susceptible to great earthquakes. Earthquakes that can
                cause total panic and considerable damage to life and property. Considerable damages happen even in
                specially designed structures. Great damage in buildings with partial or total collapse. Railway tracks
                bend and roadways get damaged; ground cracks to widths of several cm, underground pipes break,
                landslides, rockfalls and mudflows occur, large waves in water. Where intensities exceed XI, total
                destruction may be caused with changes in the landscape that could even change the courses of rivers.
                (Intensity: IX and above).</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Be sure that the proper structural design and engineering practices are followed while constructing
                    a house.
                <li>Follow and advocate local safe building codes for earthquake-resistant construction.
                <li>Follow and advocate upgrading poorly built structures.
                <li>Make a plan and be ready for an emergency.
                <li>Identify the medical centers, fire fighting stations and organize rescue mock drills for the society
                    of your area.
                <li>Know the electric and water shut off locations in your house.
                
                <li>If you are on a steep hillside, move away in case of landslides and falling rocks.
                <li>When driving a vehicle pull to the side of the road and stop.
                <li>Don’t enter partially damaged buildings. Strong aftershocks can cause further damage to the
                    buildings and weak structures may collapse.
                <li>Don’t use your telephone to call relatives and friends, call only for medical help.
                <li>Don’t use your two-wheeler/car to drive around the areas of damage. Rescue and relief operations
                    need the road for mobility.
                <li>Do not fill the overhead tank completely.
                <li>Do not carry out haphazard repairs.
                <li>Repairs should be done only under the supervision of a structural engineer.
                <li>Do not put additional supports without the guidance of an experienced/qualified structural engineer.
                <li>Stay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as
                    lighting fixtures or furniture).
                <li>When an earthquake starts, grab your emergency preparedness kit. Remember, Drop, Cover, and Hold On.
