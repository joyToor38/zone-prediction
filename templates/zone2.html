<h4 style="font-weight: normal;">
  <p>
  <ul>
    <li>
        Zone II is classified as the low-damage risk zone. This is the least seismically active zone, meaning the
        areas that fall under these zones in India have a low chance of having an earthquake. Zone II covers
        earthquake-prone areas, which are 41% of India. Here, the Indian Standard (IS) Code allots a zone factor of
        0.10.
    </li>
    <li>This zone is susceptible to earthquakes that can be felt by all and may frighten people enough to run outdoors.
      Dishes and glassware break, books fall down, heavy furniture gets moved. Few instances of fallen plaster and some
      damage to buildings may also be observed. (Intensity: I to VI)
    </li>
    <ul>
      <li>
        During earthquakes, drop to the floor, take cover under a sturdy desk or table, and hold on to it so that it
        doesnâ€™t move away from you. Wait there until the shaking stops.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heavy objects such as televisions, computers and stereos are usually placed on top of cabinets, bookcases and
        tables. Fasten these items so they will not slide off during an earthquake. Such simple structural measures are
        vital to maintaining safety during an earthquake.

      <li>
        Secure your water tank

      </li>
      <li>
        Secure the flower pots from falling off.
